When a message does land in your inbox, it will most likely fall under these four main types:\nNope, not Water, Earth, Fire, and Air.\n1 - Transactional Emails These are messages you get from interacting with a website or a service. These messages are automatic and are expected by the person triggering an action that results to a feedback, which in this case, is an email. The open and click through rates for these kinds of messages are higher than the other types of email marketing messages because it is expected. Below are some examples:\nReceipts - If you’ve ever ordered online, you may have received a receipt for your order. Here’s an example from one of my Shopee orders with the subject line: \"Your COD order #200917xxxxxxxx has been confirmed\"\nHere’s my shopping receipt\nForgot password links - This is one of the most used function in any membership website, and I bet you’ve done this quite a few times. The password reset link is sent to your email address instantly and you take action quickly as well. Recently I had to do this because I wanted to recover access to my Photobucket account and take a look at what photos I still have there. The email I got from them has a subject line: \"Please update your password\".\nI suggest using a password manager so you won’t have to remember password or go through password resets. (I personally use Bitwarden).\n2 - Promotional Emails These are messages that are promoting a content, product, or service, and has a limited time offer. It’s a way to engage with the members and make sure that they are continuously participating in the website or service. Use promos sparingly as having too much of this might negatively impact your open rates due to promo fatigue. Here are some examples of this type of email:\nDiscounts - I signed up for jetBlue’s newsletter, just because it’s one of the brands that I look up to and I love how they write their emails and copies in general. They find a way to convey their message beautifully in just a few sentences. Here’s an email from them back in March, with the subject line: \"Fares from $49 one-way. Forward... March!\"\nI subscribed to jetBlue just to take a look at their emails.\nPromo Codes - Most email tools (ESPs) has a capability to distribute unique promo codes that is exclusive per user. Here’s one from Crate \u0026 Barrel that reads \"Open for your exclusive promocode →\":\nPromo code from Crate \u0026 Barrel\n3 - Informational Emails These are messages that informs or engages with the member which may have a call-to-action, like updating a profile or uploading their first video, but does not have any offers upon completion. Some examples of these are:\nNewsletters - I subscribe and read a daily financial newsletter called Merkado Barkada that covers news about the Philippine stock market. Here’s one example of their newsletter with the headline 'NTC claps back at NOW for selling \"4th telco\"' and a bonus meme inside:\nAn email from Merkado Barkada, one of the Newsletters I subscribe to.\nBilling Reminders - Yes, the dreaded due date. Your public utilities send these monthly to remind you of upcoming bills you have to pay. You have no choice but to open this to know how much you owe! Here’s one from my electricity provider\nThe kid made art from the electricity bill LOL.\n4 - Hybrid Email You can always combine any of the above types, for example, your receipt email might have other item recommendations based on your purchase, or your newsletter has a promo code inside. Try to mix and match to get the result you want.\nHere’s a part of the receipt email I got for the coffee beans I ordered with a ‘You may also like’ recommendation section:\nWrap up If you’re creating your email plans, you can start by coming up with what messages can be categorized into these types. What are your transactional messages? When will you do your promotional messages? Will you do a monthly statement of account? What can you mix and match? Build up your basics and expand later on. Are there other email marketing message types that I missed?
